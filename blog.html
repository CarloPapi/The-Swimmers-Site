        Here is a video of me during practice swimming various events I have
        competed in in the past. It includes 50 fly, 50 back, 50 breaststroke,
        50 free, 100 IM, 200 IM, 200 Free, and 100 Free. Some of which I
        repeated. All of these clips were taken over 3 days (The video is a
        little long, feel free to skim through it, especially the 200 frees!)

        <div id="rundown-caption">
          I'm currently on two competitive swim teams where my coaches push me
          to my limits, often involving challenging sprints. I decided to
          integrate high-speed sprints into my practices to improve my times.
          Over three days, I aimed to either match or beat my previous best
          times, although I couldn't break any records. While reviewing the
          footage, I discovered various technique issues in my strokes, some of
          which were more serious than I realized. To make it even more
          challenging, I started working on correcting these issues with the
          guidance of my coaches. Though it's a work in progress, I made some
          improvements. So, my challenge primarily focused on improving my swim
          times, and while I didn't break all my records, I made strides in
          addressing technique issues.

          While I have been on Lifetime's swim team for a long time, seeing
          myself swim gave me a new perspective, especially with my technique.
          While I always knew my technique wasn't perfect, actually seeing it
          allows me to really focus in on correcting it. Now that I can actually
          see the technique issues, I have a better idea of what NOT to do, so
          this challenge will be beneficial in the long run. Also, another
          takeaway I have are the speeds of my 200s. To be blunt, not only from
          the footage, but from my times, the fact is simple: my 200s are slow.
          I know I am capable of going significantly faster. I do not think it
          is a stamina or endurance issue that is the cause of my slow pace,
          for, to me, 200 is not a great distance. Of course it's more difficult
          when you're racing it, but nonetheless, I can sustain it with relative
          ease. My issue is a pacing issue that needs correction.
