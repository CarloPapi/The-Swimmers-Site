        I currently attend Emily Carr Secondary School in the tenth grade, and I
        have been <br />
        in the pool for as long as I can remember. I am currently a part of two
        swim teams; <br />
        Vaughan LifeTime Athletic Swim Team, and the ECSS school swim team. For
        LifeTime, <br />
        I am currently at the Gold level, and I have competed against other gyms
        and clubs, some <br />
        of which were ot her Lifetimes such as Ajax LifeTime Athletic, and
        Mississauga LifeTime Athletic, <br />
        as well as other clubs including the Boulevard Club. The ECSS school
        swim team has <br />
        restarted this year (from 2019) and I joined it. In some of the photos
        and videos, I am wearing the <br />
        ECSS swim team cap, others, the LifeTime <em>Swim</em> cap. I haven't
        yet competed for ECSS, but a few <br />
        competitions are due next month.
