          Fares Ksebati's YouTube channel is a channel dedicated to the sport of swimming. 
          Many of his videos include different bits of technique advise and tips, endurance 
          training programs, and even some warnings against drowning, emphasising even good 
          swimmers are still at risk of drowning. He even did a mock video to demonstrate 
          the effects of drag; he swam a 50 metre freestyle timed sprint in a full-on busienss 
          suit (which included a jacket, a tie, a belt, and all of the other components of a suit) 
          to see how it affected his time.
